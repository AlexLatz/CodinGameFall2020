# CodinGame Fall 2020 Challenge

This was my attempt at the CodinGame Fall 2020 challenge. I placed 1,667th in the Silver League, or 2,232nd overall.

My best solution ended up being the PQCacheDepth file, as the Java GC limited the success of more performant methods. As I couldn't correctly time each move, the GC prevented the best solution, SpellCacheTime, from working properly.

The HeuristicSort file was my initial approach, using purely heuristics and comparators, and was fairly successful considering it couldn't plan into the future.
